I'm super excited to chat with you and thanks for being here Matt, thank you. Thanks for inviting me congratulations on the success of your podcast. I have Been an eager fan of this podcast because i've loved so many of your interviews It's very hard to stand out and it seems as though you've been standing out by helping others stand out Well, thank you. I appreciate that and i'm excited to hear what we have to talk about today. So let's get started I know you spend a lot of time helping leaders communicate more effectively One of the things you talk about is leaders are often translators And i'd love for you to share with our listeners what that means for you because I wholly agree I think that's exactly right help us understand how a leader is a translator and what are some things people can do to be better translators? in order for anyone to take action on your ideas in order for you to persuade Persuasion simply means combining words and ideas to move people to action Requires that the listener understands clearly the desired action You're often speaking depending on your field in a very different language Even if you're speaking to someone who's speaking the same language, that's not the point You're using words and complexity and jargon and shortcuts abbreviations and acronyms That your listener doesn't understand simply because they're not in the same field Let me give you an example I think this is the best way of describing what a translator is I'm going to give you an example that i've been thinking about since i've been booked for your podcast because it just happened recently I spoke to a prominent global scientist. Her name is Annie Kreischer She plays a crucial role in a recent headline grabbing experiment in what's called fusion Which is replicating the sun's power for renewable energy A very prominent scientist in stem and an advocate for women in science So I caught up with her and I asked her please explain in plain english to a non-scientist What is it that you achieved? Because they made the again this headline grabbing experiment what she said is here's exactly her words Carmine we're bringing the same process that powers the sun to the earth To harness the energy in a controlled setting It's important because it's the holy grail of the clean energy future Anyone can understand that and understand that she was using metaphors Like it's the holy grail harnessing the power of the sun bringing it to earth simple understandable I went back to annie and I said annie do me a favor How would you explain it to a peer? How would you explain this experiment to a peer without? missing a beat Because it's so easy for her to do it. She said oh, that's easy. We were able to achieve ignition a rapid increase in deuterium temperature associated with alpha particle self-heating by increasing the hot spot plasma energy density I had to read that from a paper because there's no way I could remember that I was blown away, man. I was like, oh my goodness. It's a completely different language On the fly she could translate This incredibly complex science experiment and this milestone in science She can translate it depending on her audience And I asked her how were you able to do this? She said I didn't learn it in school, which is why we need podcasts like this You don't learn this stuff in school, but she said communication is the number one skill Leaders need to align teams around a bold mission Matt if you cannot explain the science to get buy-in from investors stakeholders peers agencies regulators government If you cannot speak the same language to different stakeholders and adapt the language for those different stakeholders You'll never get anything done Thank you so much for sharing that example carmine. That is a Classic crystal clear example of the power of training She knew her audience and was able to adjust she used a tool like an analogy to help All of us as leaders in our roles We need to think about how we can make our content accessible so that people understand us So thank you for sharing that i'd like to turn our attention to some of your many books in your book talk like ted Which is a great helpful read Your self-study is a great way to help people understand what you're doing Helpful read your subtitle specifies that you identify the nine secrets of the world's top minds Would you mind sharing with us one or two of those secrets and how can we use those to help our communication? Talk like ted was a book that I wrote based on conversations with famous ted speakers So it's not necessarily a book on how to get on a ted stage how to fill out the form and become a ted speaker It's what can we learn? From some of the world's great speakers Who have taken a ted stage in addition to leading organizations or their teams? The one thing in particular became storytelling which is something that I know you've covered in your podcast I know that it's something that you teach at stanford storytelling is fundamental to To not only the way we communicate as humans, but to give in a ted talk or any powerful presentation So one of the ted commandments as they're really called ted commandments. These are the guidelines For anyone who wants to speak on a ted stage is to Not necessarily start with a story, although most people do but it's to tell stories personal stories because stories Inform they illuminate educate I think one of the best examples of storytelling is brian stevenson brian is a famous human rights attorney Who gave a very famous ted speech? I talked to him after his ted talk 70 of his ted talk were just personal stories Anecdotes from the people he's met the people he's helped or other folks that he has met and how they created his personality and fueled his passion for Human rights on what he does and so I asked him Why do you tell so many stories in your presentations and remember this is a guy who wins cases? Before the u.s. Supreme court so he knows how to persuade and he said carmine you have to tell stories to break down barriers between people Because it's through personal stories that we connect with one another as humans a lot of Professionals maybe people listening to this podcast get confused. I think when we talk about Storytelling they say well, i'm not a novelist I'm not a screenwriter. Well, how does storytelling apply to me? Well as a species we're Storytellers it's in our dna. It's universal across culture across languages across countries You are a storyteller first What happens when we create powerpoints? Create powerpoints all of a sudden we we lose our sense of story. It's all about bullet points And inserting text and getting the right photo or image or using the right font. We forget the narrative I believe any anyone who wants to aspire to a leadership position or career advancement or actually wants to get something done Understand that you're a storyteller first PowerPoint comes after powerpoint or a presentation Compliments the story but you have to craft the narrative first. That's the big lesson. I learned from the great ped speakers I'm smiling as you say that because almost word for word. I find myself saying the same thing story first story first And the notion that story is built into being human Absolutely accurate and I really liked how you said that story bridges and connects us to other people I encourage the people I work with the students I teach to tell me what's the story you're telling here To get them to frame it as a story rather than just a list of facts and a list of ideas While many of your books carmine address influence and persuasion a topic that our listeners are very interested in Your book five stars dives deeply into persuasion I have a specific angle i'd like you to talk about when it comes to persuasion How do you encourage people to be more effective in their persuasion in the midst of resistance? hesitation and concern About what it is you're trying to persuade people on one of the reasons why I focus on storytelling is exactly What brian stevenson told me you're most likely going to be speaking to people who are resistant to change So that's why you have to use tools and vehicles that connect one another and lower barriers between people That's why storytelling I think is a fundamental aspect of persuasion Storytelling check the other is to think about the audience first It's not about you. It's about your audience Reverse engineer and I think you do this too matt you've taught this reverse engineer the presentation reverse engineer your pitch Or your argument what is the audience's pain point? What keeps them up at night? Whenever I speak to international audiences or I travel around give keynote speeches I bombard the organizers and the people responsible for those companies with a lot of questions ahead of time I want to get into the heads of the audience. I need to know what keeps them up at night And then I reverse engineer the presentation and my argument to help them Here in silicon valley where I live I talk to a lot of adventure capitalists And people come in with their pitch and they are enamored of their technology or how cool it is or take a look at our demo And they forget act one They forget there's a three-act structure to good storytelling and act one is the setup Explaining the status quo. What is the problem with the status quo? People like steve jobs were brilliant because they could show you problems That you didn't even know you had Until after his presentation then you realize I think I do need that apple iphone. That's a brilliant persuasion But I think it's audience first and I've come to realize that very few people do that They open their powerpoint. They open a presentation and just start filling in information. That's important to them Or that's exciting to them Why should my audience care as you've said so what? My background is in journalism and Journalism 101 first day of graduate school Why should I care that is the the first question you ask? Why should your audience care about the topic? That's the headline Everything else feeds into the headline and so I suggest we reverse engineer presentations and pitches or any Business proposal of any type. Why should your audience care? What's their pain point? How is your idea or solution going to make their life better? So everybody lives happily ever after that's reverse engineering the story You summarize so nicely what many of our podcast episodes have been about which is really about structure and story and about knowing your audience And what I hear you saying the key to dealing with resistance and concern and hesitation is to make your Argument your persuasion relevant and salient to the audience and then work backwards from what their concerns are And I love that concept of reverse engineering and that's very powerful and and I think we'll go a long way to Addressing the concerns that your audience might have You have two books about steve jobs one exploring his approached innovation and the other looking at his presenting Your newest book the bezos blueprint is all about jeff bezos By your accounts both men were tenacious They worked hard on their communication and had specific approaches to their ideas And had specific approaches to it Can you highlight one or two communication principles that each of these gentlemen demonstrated? And how we reading your books and learning from you could benefit from them It's a theme that runs throughout my books whether it's steve jobs or Ted talks or a new one on jeff bezos the theme that runs across my books Is very clear to me now. Maybe it wasn't clear when I first started But I think it's very clear that Effective communicators in any field Have practiced the skill communication is above all a learned skill Great communicators are made not born steve jobs was not born nor was he early in his career? a charismatic stage presence Paul from 2007 when he introduced the iphone he became one of the greatest business storytellers of our time jeff bezos I analyzed 24 years of his writing as amazon grew in complexity His writing became simpler more concise Easier to understand and that's intentional. That's something that happens with both of these entrepreneurs Because they're intentional about improving and working on communication So the theme that I have found And it's a valuable piece of advice for everyone is that communication is a learned skill Public speaking is a learned skill the minute you think you know it all is the moment you stop growing I had a conversation with a famous astronaut a canadian astronaut named chris hadfield who gave a very famous ted talk He's called the singing astronaut. He's sang a version of a david bowie song while he was floating weightless in space We were talking specifically about his ted talk and he said, you know carmine It was interesting because i've been speaking as an astronaut for 25 years I speak to rotary clubs and organizations and schools The ted organizers gave me some tips on how to deliver a better presentation and I learned a lot But that's the point matt good communicators are learn-it-alls. They're constantly Receptive to new ideas new ways of communicating If you think you're a good speaker a good presenter and you don't need any help i'll bet that you're not nearly as effective as you think you are this notion of Continually developing and the desire to improve is something I see in all of the people I work with who have really improved And who are and are becoming good speakers this desire to improve and Being humble and giving yourself a little bit of grace to say that there are areas for improvement is really important And I appreciate you highlighting that I feel many people think that there's some endpoint when it comes to developing Communication skills and I think what you've just shared with us is what I see all the time that it's a continual process Carmen i've studied martial arts for a long long time and I very much remember when I received my first black belt My instructor looked at me and said congratulations now. Let's get started and That to me was a very powerful moment because it reminded me that there's always more to learn and I think you've highlighted that With regard to communication. Thank you. I love that. What a great anecdote. Yeah, and it's been one that's motivated me for a long time Before we end carmine. I'd like to ask you the same three questions. I ask everyone who joins me. Are you up for that? Absolutely excellent question number one if you were to capture the best communication advice You've ever received as a five to seven word presentation slide title, what would it be storytellers drive change and innovation That one's and it's encapsulated so many of the things you talked about it's about storytelling It's about being persuasive and innovative. It's about speaking in a way that makes your content accessible wonderful wonderful summary in those five to seven words Question number two and this one i'll be very curious to hear from you. Who is a communicator that you admire and why? I'll give you a modern contemporary communicator that everyone around the world is going to know And that's the billionaire warren buffett as we're speaking. I think he's the third wealthiest person on earth Warren buffett is an intentional communicator If you've read his shareholder letters, they're models of simplicity And he is an expert with using metaphor to explain complex financial ideas So this idea of investing in companies or stocks that are surrounded by a moat That originated from warren buffett and now financial analysts use it every day on business news But we like that company because it's surrounded by a moat Warren buffett is very intuitive and understands that in order to Express ideas simply you have to connect with people in language They understand and that's often metaphors and analogies that are familiar to them So I would put warren buffett at the top of my list as a contemporary communicator Warren buffett has some wonderful sayings is a great role model And one of the things I admire most about him is he is out front saying the importance of communication He says one of the best skills people can learn In their education and practice is communication. So not only is he a good role model He's a good advocate for what you and I both do Question number three What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe? Big picture before details So again think about your audience. What's the big picture? What's in it for them? Why should they care? Answer that in the first 60 seconds Then they'll be hooked for the rest of the movie get them to want to watch the movie first in the first scene So big picture first big picture then details second ingredient is Storytelling reframe the way you see yourself as a communicator. You are not a powerpoint presenter. You're a storyteller powerpoint compliments the story and Third and something very important these days more important than ever. We are bombarded by complexity and an overload of information Simplify simplify simplify Simplify by choosing simpler words easier to understand explanations uh less jargon shorter words to replace Bureaucratic language or convoluted words. I call simple the new superpower because I see how valuable it is So big picture storytelling and simplicity if you can master those three ingredients, you'll be head and shoulders above the vast majority of business professionals You've given us a very clear rubric to strive towards this notion of start with the big picture Make sure that it's relevant audience specific and tells a story and then finally make it simple and accessible Wonderful advice as has everything you've said carmine and with such a pleasure not only to get to chat with you But to watch how you model and demonstrate the things that you talk about Thank you so much. I appreciate your specific actionable advice and guidance and I wish you well with your new book Thank you so much matt. I appreciate it And I really appreciate the opportunity to speak to a receptive audience people who get it And they understand this skill and how important it is.
